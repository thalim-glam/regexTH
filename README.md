# Title: THregex

This tutorial explains how a specific regular expression, or regex, functions by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does.

## Summary
JavaScript has many useful methods that can check if a string contains a certain letter or phrase. Regular Expression or Regex is one of them, which represents a seriese of special characters that define a search pattern.

For this challenge, I chose to explain the given
````
Matching a URL â€“ /^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/
````
and the detail descriptions are provided below.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
 - There are two types of "Anchors". The caret(^) and dollar($)
 - Meta-character ^ represents the starting position of the string and 
 - Meta-character $ represents the ending position of the string.
 - For example,  /^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/ represents a Hexadeciamal value.
 
### Quantifiers
 - Regex provides a variety of quantifiers that one can use to match the sequesnce.
 - The * quantifier represents, zero or more occurences of the pattern.
 - The + quantifier represents, one or more occurences of the pattern.
 - The quantifiers are always applied to only one pattern, the one it finds to the left of the quantifier.
